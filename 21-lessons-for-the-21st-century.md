# 21 lessons for the 21st Century

Intro:
In a world deluged by irrelevant information, clarity is power.
Intend to write about important challenges and choices of this century.

Central question: liberalism emerged victorious from the 20th century, defeating communism and fascism, but is now in trouble.
Technological progress in information tech and biotech present new challenges. Will point out threats more than promises.
Artificial intelligence and biotechnology are giving humanity the power to reshape and reengineer life.
“Philosophers are very patient people, but engineers are far less so, and investors are the least patient of all. If you don’t know hat to do with the power to engineer life, market forces will not wait a thousand years for you too come up with an answer.

Will discuss shortcomings of the liberal worldview and the democratic system, because it is the most versatile and successful model humans have developed so far, so we much understand its limitations in order to understand how to adapt i.
Critical thinking bout liberalism and democracy might be hijacked by autocrats and various illiberal movements, who are happy to debate the problems of liberal democracy, but will not tolerate criticism directed at them. “It is a mark of illiberal regimes that they make free speech more difficult even outside their borders.” As author, chose to take the risk of speaking openly in order to think critically about the future of our species.

## Ch 1. Disillusionment

The liberal story emerged victorious from the 20th century. It celebrates the value and power of individual liberty, and sees the increasing liberalization and globalization of political and economic systems as the path to producing peace and prosperity for all. At the end of the 20th century, there was a sense of inevitability about the triumph of liberalism.
However, after the 2008 financial crisis, people have become increasingly disillusioned with liberalism. There has been a resurgence of walls, firewalls, tariffs, and strongmen. Few would now confidently declare that the Chinese Communist Party is on the wrong side of history. 2016, with Brexit and Trump, marked the wave of disillusionment with liberalism reaching the west. Some missed the old hierarchical world and are unwilling to give up privilege, others have concluded liberalization and globalization are a racket empowering an elite at the expense of the masses.
Now there is no dominant human story, which produces a sense of disorientation and catastrophe.

Tech accelerating change:
Technological disruption has moved so fast that it cannot be democratically understood and regulated. Now, we are approaching a point where we can shape humans themselves, not just the external world. “We will learn how to design brains, extend lives, and kill thoughts at our discretion. Nobody knows what the consequences will be. Humans were always far better at inventing tools than using them wisely.”
Ordinary people may not understand these advances, but they do have an increasing sense that the future no longer features them as the protagonist. “In the 20th century, the masses revolted against exploitation and sought to translate their vital role int eh economy into political power. Now the masses fear irrelevance, and they are frantic to use their remaining political power before it is too late… It is much harder to struggle against irrelevance than against exploitation.”

Liberalism’s crisis:
Fascism and communism both had global narratives that challenged liberalism. In this moment, the challenges are not a coherent ideological opponent, but a more nihilistic, local reactionary movement. “the breakdown of liberalism is tentatively filled by nostalgic fantasies about some local golden past.” Despite liberalism’s shortcomings, it has a much better record than its alternatives, producing unprecedented peace and prosperity. However, is has no answers to the biggest problems we face: ecological collapse and technological disruption. Liberalism relied on economic growth to solve problems, promising everyone a slice of a growing pie. But the imperative for economic growth is the cause of the ecological crisis, and increases technological disruption because it is predicate don the invention of more and more disruptive technologies.
People have expected their children to have better lives than them for several generation, but in the coming years, the younger generation might be lucky to simply preserve the same standard of living as their parents.
Can liberalism reinvent itself again, like it did in the 30’s and 60’s, or is it time for a new story that goes beyond not only old gods and nations but even the core modern values of liberty and equality?

## Ch 2. Work

Will automation put many people out of work, or will it continue creating new, different types of jobs?
Humans have physical and cognitive capabilities. In the industrial revolution, machines replaces lots of physical labor, but created new jobs that required cognitive labor. But when AI begins to outperform humans at jobs that require cognitive labor, we don’t know know of any third field of activity where humans will have an edge.
If human cognition and intuition is just pattern recognition and biochemical algorithms, there is no reasons computers cannot perform these functions. And we must not compare a single human to a single computer. The power of computing is the connectivity and updatability. We should comparing the abilities of a collection of human individuals to the abilities of an integrated network. Self driving cars could obey all local traffic laws with perfect coordination, AI doctors all of the world could be instantly updated to include state-of-the-art diagnostic criteria.
Even creative jobs stand to be automated. Art strives to produce some emotional reaction in people. Algorithmically tailored music could someday be tuned to your emotions more effectively than any human created piece.
New jobs that require AI-human cooperation will be created, but these will require high levels of expertise. People will likely not be capable of retraining from low skill to high skill jobs quickly enough. We may suffer simultaneously from high unemployment and a shortage of skilled labor.
It took over a century to adjust to the Industrial revolution. This time, we will have to adapt much quicker.

Potential solutions:
Governments could slow the pace of automation, or subsidize a lifelong education sector and provide e safety net for individuals during periods of transition.
But if a significant percentage of humanity is pushed out of the job market, we will have to explore new models for post work societies and economics.
You would expect automation’s disruption of capitalism to revive communism, but 20th century communism was build on the working class’s vital role in the economy, trying to translate that economic power into political power. How do you struggle against irrelevance rather than exploitation?
New models must aim to protect humans, not jobs. One proposal is universal basic income. Another proposes to widen the range of activities considered as “jobs”, such as childcare and volunteer work. Or instead of giving money to people, the government could subsidize all social services, and provide free education, healthcare, transportation, etc. This is basically the communist utopian vision. But the real problem is defining “universal” and “basic.”

Even if developed countries implement UBI, the dismantling of a global supply chain that once let developing countries grow richer through selling cheap labor would kick the ladder out from development. The subsidization of people made irrelevant to an economy might be feasible within a nation, but will not happen on an international level.
Also, “UBI” is supposed to cover basic needs, but once you provide something for free, it will be taken for granted and political struggles will focus on something else. If most people live for free at a subsistence level, but the elite have access to bioengineering and other enhancements that bring compounding returns, the inequality gap might actually grow to become unbridgeable, and consequently people would still be angry about inequality and lack of social mobility. Real UBI would have to address not just subsistence, but also a sense of meaning.

## Ch. 3 Liberty

Defining liberalism: In politics, liberalism believes that the voter knows best. It therefore upholds democratic elections. in economics, liberalism maintains that the customer is always right. It therefore hails free-market principles. In personal matter, liberalism encourages people to listen to themselves, be true to thenmselves, and follow their hearts — as long as they do not infringe on the liberties of others. This personal freedom is enshrined in human rights.
In this sense, both conservatives and “liberals” in the Western political spectrum still agree on many fundamental things. Both liberal and conservative politicians maintain that political authority comes from the feelings, choices, and free will of individual voters.
Referendums and elections are always about human feelings, not human rationality. If democracy were a matter of rational decision-making, there would be no reason for equal voting rights, since some are far more knowledgeable and rational than others, especially in a real of expertise. This is a potential weakness of liberal democracy, because once somebody (whether in Beijing or San Francisco) gains the technological ability to hack and manipulate the human heart, democratic politics will mutate into an emotional puppet show.
Authority might soon shift from humans to algorithms. When computers can understand and manipulate what was previously an inaccessible inner realm, “free will” will likely be exposed as a myth. Most people don’t know themselves very well, so predictive algorithms will only have to be better on average than humans. “Hacking human decision-making not only will make Big Data algorithms more reliable, but also will simultaneously make human feelings less reliable… It might become so easy to manipulate our opinions and emotions that we will be forced to rely on algorithms in the same way that a pilot suffering an attack of vertigo must ignore what his own senses are telling him and put all his trust in the machinery.”
Examples of increasing reliance upon algorithms: Use of Google search to find relevant information, use of Google map directions for navigation. Future applications could apply to career and mate choice.
“As authority shifts from humans to algorithms, we may no longer view the world as the playground of autonomous individualls struggling to make the right choices, Instead, we might perceive the entire usniverse as a flow of data, see organisms as little more than biochemical algorithms, and believe that humanity’s cosmic vocation is to create an all-encompassing data-processing system—and then merge into it.”

Ethics in programming autonomous systems:
Computers will obey an ethical framework more rigorously than humans, which makes it extra important to lay out a comprehensive ethical framework. However, if for example a self-driving car can choose to kill the driver or the pedestrian, people would prefer to buy the car that kills the pedestrian instead of themselves. Leaving the ethics to the free market may produce these socially undesirable outcomes. But if the state steps in, there is a huge burden on lawmakers to create laws that will be always followed to the letter. “Throughout history, the limitations of actually enforcing laws provided a welcome check on the biases, mistakes, and excesses of lawmakers. Do we really want a system in which the decisions of fallible politicians become as inexorable as gravity?”

=> DIgital Dictatorships
AI frightens people because they don’t trust the AI to not rebel against their human masters. But in reality, “we should feat them because they will probably always obey their masters and never rebel… The real problem with robots is not their own artificial intelligence but rather the natural stupidity and cruelty of their human masters.” Imagine: killer robots that will always carry out orders, no matter how ruthless or crazy. Genocides that failed because soldiers did not carry our orders will be carried out completely, and revolutions that succeeded because soldiers did not fire on citizens will be crushed completely. Imperial wars will not be constrained by demoralized soldiers or protesting civilians afraid of being drafted. “autonomous weapon systems are a catastrophe waiting to happen, because too many governments tend to be ethically corrupt, if not downright evil.”
Possibility of a “surveillance regime that follows not just all our external activities and utterances but can even go under our skin to observe our inner experiences.”
“In the late 20th century democracies usually outperformed dictatorships because democracies were better at data processing. A democracy diffuses the power to process information and make decisions amount many people and institutions, whereas a dictatorship concentrates information and power in one place. However, soon AI might swing the pendulum in the opposite direction. AI makes it possible to process enormous amounts of information centrally. In fact, AI makes centralized systems far more efficient than diffused systems, because machine learning works better the more information it can analyze… The main handicap of authoritarian regimes in the 20th century—the attempt to concentrate all information in one place—might become their decisive advantage in the 21st.”
“Not only will the regime know exactly how you feel, but it could also make you feel whatever it wants. The dictator might not be able to provide citizens with healthcare or equality, but he could make them love him and hate his opponents. Democracy in its present form cannot survive the merger of biotech and infotech. Either democracy will successfully reinvent itself in a radically new form or humans will come to live in “digital dictatorships.”
“We cannot predict the motivations an power of digital dictatorships in 2084, but it is very unlikely that they will just copy HItler and Stalin. Those gearing themselves up to refight the battles of the 1930s might be caught off guard by an attack from a totally different direction.”
We may still have human figureheads, the important decisions will have been shaped by AI, just like now the options on the menu are shaped by economists, bankers, and businesspeople.

AI and intelligence
Intelligence does not require consciousness. “The danger is that if we invest too much in developing aAI and too little in developing human consciousness, the very sophisticated artificial intelligence of computers might only serve to empower the natural stupidity of humans.” We’ve seen a foretaste of how algorithmically tailored propaganda can exploit people’s existing prejudices. “we might be facing a banal apocalypse of clicking.”
“We are now creating tame humans that produce enormous amounts of data and function as very efficient chips in a huge data-processing mechanism, but these data-cows hardly maximize the human potential.” We have no idea what our full potential is because we know so little about the mind. Yet research into developing human abilities mainly serve the immediate needs of the economic and political system, rather than long-term needs as human beings. “If we are not careful, we will end up with downgraded humans misusing upgraded computers to wreak havoc on themselves and on the world.”

## Ch. 4 Equality

The liberal dream of increasing equality is also dying, as it looks like this century might create the most unequal societies in history. “just as humankind seems about to achieve global unification, the species itself might divide into different biological castes.”
AI may eliminate the economic value and political power of most humans at the same time that it would enable the super rich to purchase biological upgrades. The elite have always imagined that they ruled due to innate superiority, but as far as we know, the average duke wasn’t more talented than the average peasant. However, once creativity and intelligence can be augmented, a gap may emerge between rich and poor that becomes increasingly impossible to close. “The future of the masses will then depend on the goodwill of a small elite. Maybe there is goodwill for a few decades. But in a time of crisis—like climate catastrophe—it would be very tempting and easy to toss the superfluous people overboard…. Ruling oligarchies in countries as diverse as the United States and Russia might merge and make common cause against the mass of ordinary humans.”  
“Throughout this book, I often use the first person plural to speak about the future of humankind. But maybe there is no “we”. Maybe one of our biggest problems is that different human groups have completely different futures. Maybe in some parts of the world you should teach our kids to write computer code, while in others you had better teach them to draw fast and shoot straight.”

Who owns the data?
If we want to prevent the concentration of all wealth and power into the hands of a small elite, the key is to regulate the ownership of data. The primary means of production has changed from land in the agricultural era, to factories in machines in the industrial era, to platforms and data in the information era. “Politics will be a struggle to control the flow of data. If data becomes concentrated in too few hands, humankind will split into different species.”
The race to accumulate data is already on between tech giants. Targeted advertising is only a short-term goal, as eventually platforms that know enough about us will be able to suggest perfect products, dis-intermediating advertisers. In the longer term, data giants will “use this knowledge not just make choices for us or manipulate us but also to reengineer organic life and create inorganic life forms.” This is why even when institutions don’t know what to do with data today, they hold on to it because it may hold the key to controlling and shaping life in the future.
At present, people are happy to give away their data in exchange for free services. But it’s a bad trade, and will get harder to reverse. “Humans and machines might merge so completely that humans will not be able to survive at all if they are disconnected from the network.”
Mandating governments to nationalize data will curb the power of corporations, but could then result in digital dictatorships.
“Private ownership of one’s own data may sound more attractive than either of these options, but it is unclear what it actually means… Over the past two centuries we have become extremely sophisticated in regulating the ownership of industry; thus today I can own a piece of General Motors and a bit of Toyota by buying their shares. But we don’t have much experience in regulating the ownership of data”
“how to you regulate the ownership of data? This may well be the most important political question of our era. If we cannot answer this question soon our sociopolilcal system might collapse. People are already sensing the coming cataclysm. Perhaps this is why citizens ll over the world are losing faith in the liberal story, which just a decade ago seemed irresistible.
“Might networked algorithms form the scaffolding for a global human community that could collectively own all the data and oversee the future development of life?”

## Pt. II

## The Political Challenge

## Ch. 5 Community

Increasing engagement on digital platforms comes at the expense of real-world relationships and community ties.

## Ch. 6 Civilization

The “clash of civilizations” thesis, that global mayhem is caused by clash between “Western civilization” and “Islamic Civilization”, is inherently flawed. Despite the fact that people still have different religions and national identities, when it comes to important markers of a civilization — the money, science, and even the concept of the nation-state itself — people are united in a global civilization. Religions of different societies used to have different approaches to treating illness, and currencies were very distinct. But now, even the group most adamant on establishing a global Islamic civilization, ISIS, uses Western medicine and recognizes the fungibility of dollar bills. All struggles now are essentially fraternal struggles within one civilization.
Even if we wanted to separate back into distinct civilizations, the challenges of the 21st century are global in nature. Ecological devastation and technological acceleration cannot be addressed by one country alone.

## Ch 7. Nationalism

Nationalism extends beyond familial and tribal boundaries to create mass loyalties. However, it becomes dangerous when it changes from caring about one’s country to only caring about one’s country at the expense of all others.

Nuclear
Nuclear weapons necessitated a strong international regime of cooperation that would prevent nuclear war and safeguard global peace. Unfortunately we may have become too used to this achievement and fail to protect it.

Climate Change
Nationalism is also incapable of addressing climate change. Any effective strategy must be done on a global level. And unlike nuclear war, which would be equally destructive to all nations, some nations could benefit from a warming world. “Since there is no national answer to the problem of global warming, some nationalist politicians prefer to pretend the problem does not exist.”

Technological disruption
There is also no nationalist answer to technological disruption. While the others may threaten humanity’s survival, disruptive technologies might change the deepest nature of humanity itself. Should there be internationally agreed upon limits to bioengineering, for example?

## Ch. 8 Religion

How relevant are traditional religions to the future? They are irrelevant to technical and policy problems, and extremely relevant to identity problems, but often constitute part of the problem rather than the solution.
Religion used to hold sway over fields like medicine or farming, but has given way to science. Science’s ability to admit and learn from failure allows it to advance. “Over the centuries, even the true believers have noticed the difference, which is why religious authority has been dwindling in more and more technical fields. This is also why the entire world has increasingly become a single civilization. When things really work, everybody adopts them.”
However, civilization depends on mass cooperation which is held together through shared narratives, and religion helps provide that narrative. An example of a modern civilization using a religion to strengthen the state was pre-war Japan, which turned Shinto into a state religion with the Emperor at the head, and preached a buddhist version of self sacrifice for the nation. North Korea created a new religion out of whole cloth to deify the ruling family. So religions still hold a lot of power, but tend to exacerbate nationalist conflicts rather than help solve global problems.

## Ch. 9 Immigration

Clarifying the debate on immigration, with the main questions the two sides tend to talk past each other on:

1.  Is it a right or a privilege for immigrants to be taken into host countries?
2.  How far should immigrants be expected to assimilate to the host society?
3.  How much time needs to pass before immigrants become full members of society?
4.  Are both sides living up to their obligations?
    21st century discrimination has mostly shifted from racism to culturism — the claim that some culture are inherently better than others. Different cultural practices may be adaptive in different contexts, but the question remains of how much culture of immigrants should change.

## Part III. Despair and Hope

## Ch 10. Terrorism

There is an overblown fear of terrorism, but in reality it is mainly an ideological battle waged by a weaker party. Fear is usually a byproduct of material losses in conventional war, but in terrorism, fear is the main objective, and there is a huge disproportion between the actual strength of the terrorists and the fear they inspire.
Normal war seeks to damage the enemy’s capacity to fight back, either structurally or logistically. Terrorism’s targeting of civilian targets with no military utility shows that they have no hope of actually damaging the enemy, but hope to strike a disproportionate amount of fear into them and provoke an overblown reaction that will give them an opening. Although senior military officers were killed at the Pentagon on 9/11, we mainly remember the twin towers falling because of the immense audiovisual effect. “Because we intuitively understand that terrorism is theater, we judge it by its emotional rather than material impact.” So our biggest danger from terrorist attacks is overreacting.
States could quietly and forcefully suppress terrorists, which they often do, but sometimes after acts of violence that outrage the public, they overreact. “States find it difficult to withstand these provocation because the legitimacy of the modern state is based on its promise to keep the public sphere free of political violence.” In the middle ages, the ability to use violence was the entry ticket into the political game, and whoever lacked this lacked voice. Terrorism had no place in such a world, since anybody not strong enough to cause material damage was of no consequence. If a few muslim fanatics murdered civilians in Jerusalem, demanding that Crusaders leave the Holy Land, the reaction would have been ridicule instead of terror. However, now civilians consider it their right to be protected from violence, so a few acts of political violence become a threat to the legitimacy and even survival of the state. “the theater of terror generates visceral fears of anarchy, making people feel as if the social order is about to collapse. After centuries of bloody struggles we have crawled out of the black hold of violence, but we sense that the black hole is still there, patiently waiting to swallow us again. A few gruesome atrocities, an we imagine that we are falling back in. In order to assuage the fears, the state is driven to respond to the theater of terror with its own theater of security.”

## Ch 11. War

The last few decades have been the most peaceful in human history. The 20th century was so bloody because at the start, great powers remembered many examples of successful wars that had enlarged their territory and enriched them. Now, almost nobody remembers a successful war. “In the age of conquerers, warfare was a low-damage, high profit affair. Nuclear weapons and cyberwarfare, by contrast, are high-damage, low-profit technologies. You can use such tools to destroy entire countries but not to build profitable empires.”
However, despite war no longer being a great strategy, we should not underestimate the human capacity for stupidity.

## Ch 12. Humility

Most peoples and culture place their own society at the center of their narrative about the world. This is silly and bad for rational decision making. Harari goes into an in-depth example of the Jews and Israel’s overblown sense of self-importance, since he is a Jew from Israel and therefore feels it is ok to criticize his own people’s lack of humility. He leaves it to other people to criticize their own traditions.

## Ch. 13 God

There is God of the cosmic mystery - why did the big bang happen, etc. And God of the trifling human laws — cover your hair in public, etc. The cosmic mystery is often used to justify trifling human laws, although “the deeper the mysteries of the universe, the less likely it is that whatever is responsible for them gives a damn about female dress codes or human sexual behavior.”

Godless ethics
Religious faith is not a precondition to acting morally — in fact the idea that it is assumes there is something unnatural about morality. Yet many animal species have implicit social rules governing being a good member of the pack, and they obviously aren’t religious. Religious belief can also serve to stoke anger and hatred, so it does not really solve questions of morality.

## Ch. 14 Secularism

Secularism claims no monopoly on wisdom and goodness, but views it as the natural legacy of all humans. Secular people are comfortable with multiple, hybrid identities. The most important secular commitment is to the truth, which is based on observation and evidence rather than mere faith. The other chief commitment of secular people is to compassion. “There is something deeply troubling and dangerous about people wh avoid killing just because “god says so”. Such people are motivated by obedience rather than compassion, and what will they do if they come to believe that their god commands them to kill heretics, witches, adulterers, or foreigners?”
Secular people face difficult dilemmas, in the absence of divine commandments, but when facing these they weigh the feelings of all concerned parties, examine wide range of observations and possibilities, and search for a middle path that will cause as little harm as possible.
“The twin commitments to truth and compassion result also in a commitment to equality. Though opinions differ regarding questions of economic and political equality, secular people are fundamentally suspicious of all a priori hierarchies. Suffering is suffering, no matter who experiences it, and knowledge is knowledge.”
In order to seek truth, it is necessary to also value freedom of though and the right to doubt.
“People afraid of losing their truth tend to be more violent than people who are used to looking at the world from several different viewpoints. Questions you cannot answer are usually far better for you than answers you cannot question.”
Finally, secularism values responsibility, because ultimately it is humans and not some divine overlord who is responsible for the state of society and the world.

The main problem with secularism is it sets the ethical bar too high. Most people cannot live up to such a demanding code, especially in times of crisis. Many supposedly secular ideologies have morphed into dogmas over time. Secularism must examine its own blind spots and how it has been perverted into murderous dogmas, just as Christianity has. “Marxists should ask themselves what it was about the teachings of Marx that paved the way to the gulag, scientists should consider how the scientific project lent itself so easily to destabilizing the global ecosystem, and geneticists in particular should take warning from the way the Nazis hijacked Darwinian theories.”
Secularism’s strength has always been in also admitting its blind spots, for “if you believe in a quest for truth by fallible humans, admitting blunders is part of the game.” This is why undogmatic secular movements tend to make relatively modest promises.

## Part IV Truth

## Ch. 15 Ignorance

Liberal thought and democracy believe in the rational individual. Yet we often think in groups and treat the knowledge in the minds of others as though it were our own, since we benefit from so much accumulated knowledge and engineering. The world is becoming increasingly complex, and people rarely appreciate their ignorance of what is going on. Scientists how to dispel wrong views through education, but “most of our views are shaped through communal groupthink rather than individual rationality, and we hold on to these views due to group loyalty. Most people don’t like too many facts, and they certainly don’t like to feel stupid.

The black hole of power
Not only are crowds fallible, but so are leaders. Most leaders are too busy to spend time deeply learning and seeking the truth. “If you cannot afford to waste time, you will never find the truth. Worse still, great power inevitably distorts the truth. Power is all about changing reality rather than seeing it for what it is.” Everyone around powerful people have some agenda, so cannot be trusted to give objective feedback.
“If you really want truth, you need to escape the black hold of power and allow yourself to waste a lot of time wandering here and there on the periphery. Revolutionary knowledge rarely makes is way to the center, because the center is built on existing knowledge.”

## Ch. 16 Justice

We deal better concrete examples of injustice and suffering in front of us, but in a complex global world of interconnected supply chains and second-order effects, it is difficult to know whether we are contributing to suffering and therefore difficult to eradicate injustice that nobody is directly responsible for. People use four methods to resolve these kinds of moral dilemmas:

1.  Downsize the issue, such as imagining the Syrian civil war as between two people.
2.  Focus on a troubling human story that ostensibly stands for the whole conflict
3.  Weave conspiracy theories
4.  Deny the true complexity of the world by adhering to a dogma

## Ch 17. Post-Truth

Propaganda and disinformation is nothing new. As long as everybody believes in the same fictions, we all obey the same laws and can therefore cooperate effectively.
“When a thousand people believe some made-up story for a month, that’s fake news. When a billion people believe it for a thousand years, that’s a religion, and we are admonished not to cal it “fake news” in order not to hurt the feelings of the faithful (or incur their wrath).”
Modern secular dogmas have also used this principle. Goebbels: “A lie told once remains a lie, but a lie told a thousand times becomes the truth.”
Since it is impossible to hide things such as the murder of millions now, modern propaganda takes the form of disinformation and misdirection instead.
What is the utility of truth, really? “the power of human cooperation depends on a delicate balance between truth and fiction. If you stick to unalloyed reality, few people will follow you.” False stories actually have an advantage, since if people believe something with no evidence, they are more likely to be loyal no matter what.
“As a species, humans prefer power to truth. We spend far more time and effort on trying to control the world than on trying to understand it—and even when we try to understand it, we usually do so in the hope that understanding the world will make it easier to control it.”
However, it is still worth striving to approximate the truth. How to avoid brainwashing: 1. If you want reliable information, pay good money for it. 2. If some issue seems exceptionally important to you, make the effort to read the relevant scientific literature (original sources)

## Ch. 18 Science Fiction

Talks about the Matrix, Disney’s Inside Out, and Brave New World.

## Part V Resilience

## Ch. 19 Education

Instead of memorizing information, people need the ability to make sense of information, to tell the difference between what is important and what is unimportant, and to combine this into a broad picture of the world. Teaching will have to prepare students for drastic career changes, teaching mental flexibility and emotional balance.

## Ch 20 Meaning

Goes over different scripts humans have accepted to give their lives meaning. “Like movie stars, humans like only those scripts that reserve an important role for them.” A successful story does not have to explain the world, but merely offer people a protagonist role and keep their attention. “People may display the same murderous fanaticism for the sake of a thousand year old nation as for the sake of a billion year old god. People are just not good with large numbers. In most cases, it takes surprisingly little to exhaust our imagination.” Many stories are held together by the social institutions that depend on them rather than by their supporting evidence, which can be very flimsy.
Rituals create the emotional resonance to make a story feel real. In particular, rituals that require sacrifice make stories feel real, because suffering is very real. “Once you suffer for a story, it is usually enough to convince you that the story is real. Maybe you are just paying the price of your gullibility. However, most people don’t like to admit they are fools. Consequently, the more they sacrifice for a particular belief, the stronger their faith becomes.”
Alternatively, the sacrificing of other people can make people believe, since “Either the story is true or I am a cruel villain.” “Unable to live up to the ideal, people turn to sacrifice as a solution.”
Humans often believe in several stories at the same time, some of them contradictory. This made religions consider faith a cardinal virtue, as if there were something intrinsically good about believing things without evidence. Secular society puts all ideas on an equal footing, giving individuals the ability to choose. However, this is predicated on there being a true or core self who can choose accurately. The difficulty is that although we can choose what to do, we cannot choose our desires.

## Ch. 21 Meditation

Meditation is a tool for observing the mind directly. Do a 10-day Vipassana retreat, it will teach you a lot about yourself.
