# Surveillance Capitalism

by Shoshana Zuboff

Mostly this book was interesting for the stories of battles over privacy that were fought and lost, which I was never aware of. There was also a wealth of quotes illustrating a variety of insider perspectives.

A central metaphor of this book is that users are not the customer, but rather the "raw materials" of the business - they provide the data that is aggregated, analyzed, and sold to the real customers, the advertisers. Zuboff calls the data that accrues from our behavior online the "behavioral surplus."

At first, the uses for user data was "found", then as the business model became clearer, it was hunted down.

Free services monetized through user data have become both a successful business model and a national security interest - the government has come "to rely on private enterprise to collect and generate information for it." Successful political campaigns have also become dependent on the predictive power in this wealth of information.

Monopolies are generally thought of as cornering markets through unfairly eliminating competition in order to raise prices at will. However "surveillance capitalism" is more about cornering user-derived raw-material supplies. Regulatory interventions designed to address traditional monopolies are likely to have little effect.

As an example, Google's competitive strategy with Apple involved releasing Android as an open source OS in order to produce more searches. "they are not trying to make a profit on Android... They want to take any layer that lives between themselves and the consumer and make it free (or even less than free)... In essence, they are not just building a moat; Google is also scorching the earth for 250 miles around the outside of the castle to ensure no one can approach it."

Google's rise as information monopoly

"It was Google that recognized the gold dust in teh detritus of its interactions with its users and took teh trouble to collect it up... Google exploits information that is a by-product of user interactions, or data exhaust, which is automatically recyclted to improve the service or create an entirely new product. p. 68

Users are not the customers, or the product, but the source of raw-material data supply.

"The balance of power made it financially risky and possibly counterproductive to charge users a fee for search services. Selling search results would also have set a dangerous precedent for the firm, assigning a price to indexed information that Google's web crawler had already taken from others without payment.

Sergey Brin and Larry Page paper, “The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Web Search Engine”

“We expect that advertising funded search engines will be inherently biased towards the advertises and away from the needs of the consumers. This type of bias is very difficult to detect but could still have a significant effect on the market...we believe the issue of advertising causes enough mized incentives that it is crucial to have a competitive search engine that is transparent and in the academic realm." p 71

Larry and Sergei's first paper on Google was skeptical of ad-funded search. “We expect that advertising funded search engines will be inherently biased towards the advertises and away from the needs of the consumers."

Google's first revenues came from licensing deals and sponsored ads. After Dot Com bust, pressure to make profit mounted. Pivoted to mining behavioral data to target ads.

“A one-way mirror embodies the specific social relations of surveillance based on asymmetries of knowledge and power."

Invention of "behavioral surplus": Google would now secure more behavioral data than it needed to serve its users. That surplus, a behavioral surplus, was the game-changing, zero-cost asset that was diverted from service improvement towards a highly lucrative market exchange. p. 81

Former Google exec: “Larry opposed any path that would reveal our technological secrets or stir the privacy pot and endanger our ability to gather data."

People didn't know how much data we collected... so why begin a conversation that would confuse and concern everyone?

Two men at Google who do not enjoy the legitimacy of the vote, democratic oversight, or the demands of shareholder governance exercise control over the organization and presentation of the world's information.

One man at Facebook who does not enjoy the legitimacy of the vote, democratic oversight, or the demands of shareholder governance exercises control over an increasingly universal means of social connection along with information concealed in its networks.

Information monopolies are not like traditional monopolies, they are not eliminating competition to raise prices. Instead they are cornering the market on user-derived data, the raw material of their industry. There is no monetary price for users because users are more like supply routes than customers.

"We are the source of the coveted commodity; our experience is the target of extraction. p.13

Weaponizing open source with Android - by making it free, they eliminate competition that could come between them and the consumer. "they are not just building a moat; Google is also scorching the earth for 250 mile around the castle to ensure no one can approach it.

Frontiers of expansion

The push for IoT is an incursion of this business model from the digital world into the physical. The narrative of inevitability around IoT may be driven more by economic imperatives than consumer demand. Managing director of smart devices firm: "There's all that dumb real estate out there and we've got to turn it into revenue. The 'internet of things' is all push, not pull. Most consumers do not feel a need for these devices. You can say 'exponential' and 'inevitable' as much as you want. The bottom line is that the Valley has decided that this has to be the next big thing so that firms here can grow."

The fight over facial recognition laws is also a frontier of this business model. In 2015 there was an attempt to produce public guidelines on the creation and use of biometric information. The companies insisted on their right to use facial-recognition systems without first obtaining consent. Consumer advocates walked out in protest, and the resulting guidelines offered no meaningful protections for individuals. Companies are simply "encouraged" to make their policies "available to consumers, in a reasonable manner." Most individuals don't even know this is a matter they should be aware of, much less have a meaningful choice in.
