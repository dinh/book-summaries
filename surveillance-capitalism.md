# Surveillance Capitalism

by Shoshana Zuboff

Mostly this book was interesting for the stories of battles over privacy that were fought and lost, which I was never aware of. There was also a wealth of quotes illustrating a variety of insider perspectives.

A central metaphor of this book is that users are not the customer, but rather the "raw materials" of the business - they provide the data that is aggregated, analyzed, and sold to the real customers, the advertisers. Zuboff calls the data that accrues from our behavior online the "behavioral surplus."

At first, the uses for user data was "found", then as the business model became clearer, it was hunted down.

Free services monetized through user data have become both a successful business model and a national security interest - the government has come "to rely on private enterprise to collect and generate information for it." Successful political campaigns have also become dependent on the predictive power in this wealth of information.

Monopolies are generally thought of as cornering markets through unfairly eliminating competition in order to raise prices at will. However "surveillance capitalism" is more about cornering user-derived raw-material supplies. Regulatory interventions designed to address traditional monopolies are likely to have little effect.

As an example, Google's competitive strategy with Apple involved releasing Android as an open source OS in order to produce more searches. "they are not trying to make a profit on Android... They want to take any layer that lives between themselves and the consumer and make it free (or even less than free)... In essence, they are not just building a moat; Google is also scorching the earth for 250 miles around the outside of the castle to ensure no one can approach it."

Frontiers of expansion

The push for IoT is an incursion of this business model from the digital world into the physical. The narrative of inevitability around IoT may be driven more by economic imperatives than consumer demand. Managing director of smart devices firm: "There's all that dumb real estate out there and we've got to turn it into revenue. The 'internet of things' is all push, not pull. Most consumers do not feel a need for these devices. You can say 'exponential' and 'inevitable' as much as you want. The bottom line is that the Valley has decided that this has to be the next big thing so that firms here can grow."

The fight over facial recognition laws is also a frontier of this business model. In 2015 there was an attempt to produce public guidelines on the creation and use of biometric information. The companies insisted on their right to use facial-recognition systems without first obtaining consent. Consumer advocates walked out in protest, and the resulting guidelines offered no meaningful protections for individuals. Companies are simply "encouraged" to make their policies "available to consumers, in a reasonable manner." Most individuals don't even know this is a matter they should be aware of, much less have a meaningful choice in.
