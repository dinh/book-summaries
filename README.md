# Book summaries

Notes and summaries of some books. 

1. [21 Lessons for the 21st Century, by Yuval Harari](21-lessons-for-the-21st-century.md) - Some good insights, but lacks cohesion. Interesting to see more in-depth opinions on contemporary topics from author of Sapiens. A tour of SV dinner party topics for a broader audience.
