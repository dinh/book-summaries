# Book summaries

Notes and summaries of some books.

[The human use of human beings, Norbert Weiner](the-human-use-of-human-beings.md) - One of my favorite books. Norbert Weiner predicted the potential and pitfalls of our era before anyone else.

[Surveillance Capitalism, by Shoshana Zuboff](surveillance-capitalism.md) - Lots of stories from battles over privacy that were fought and lost. Framing of user data as the raw material of the industry.

[21 Lessons for the 21st Century, by Yuval Harari](21-lessons-for-the-21st-century.md) - Some good insights, but lacks cohesion. Interesting to see more in-depth opinions on contemporary issues from author of Sapiens. Points out challenges and raises questions that it does not attempt to answer.

[AI Superpowers - China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order](ai-superpowers.md) - Why China will beat the US in AI development, and why that's insignificant compared to the bigger threat posed by instability caused by job loss and inequality. Inside look at dynamics of China's tech ecosystem, advantages of government-led innovation pushes.
