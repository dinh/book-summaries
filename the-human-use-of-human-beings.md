# The human use of human beings - cybernetics and society

by Norbert Weiner

This is one of my favorite history of technology books, it's insane how prescient Norbert Weiner was.

He starts off on how this book is dedicated to the new kind of science that deals more with probabilities than certainties, and the theory of messages he has been working on is a probabilistic theory.

He invented the term "cybernetics" (from which we get the prefix "cyber"), derived from the Greek word kubernetes or steersman, which shares a root with "governor". It is a field dedicated to the study of communication and control.

"Society can only be understood through a study of the messages and the communication facilities which belong to it; and that in the future development of these messages and communication facilities, messages between man and machines, between machines adn man, and between machine and machine, are destined to play an ever-increasing part." p. 16

Communication and control is a fight against entropy. The information carried by a set of messages is a measure of organization - it is possible to interpret information as essentially the negative of entropy, and the negative log of probability. The more probable a message, the less information it gives.

Information, in Batesman's words, is the difference that makes a difference.

For Weiner, humans, machines, and even societies are analagous in their attempts to control entropy through feedback. They are all systems with inputs and outputs, operating in response to feedback, striving to hold back nature's tendency towards disorder. Both exempl9ify locally anti-entropic processes.

Sensory organs and effector organs - the first receive input, the second act upon the world.

Progress

Americans believe in progress both as a fact and an ethical principle - they have in recent generations seen the world get better through new inventions, and believe it can and should go on until we achieve a Heaven on Earth. However, this belief belongs to a small part of recorded history, and is discontinuous with the fatalism of religions. The last four hundred years are highly special, as a result of increased communication and mastery over nature, but which "on a limited planet like the earth, may prove in the long run to be an increased slavery to nature. For the more we get out of the world the less we leave, and in the long run we shall hae to pay our debts at a time that may be very inconvenient for our own survival." p 46
Weiner describes a "progress trap" - at a certain point, there is no rolling back technological advances, the population depends on it. We can no longer live in our new environment. "Progress imposes not only new possibilities for the future but new restrictions"

Discusses communication and social structure. "Most of us in the United States prefer to live in a moderately loose social community... Until white supremacy ceases to belong to the creed of a large part of the country it will be an ideal from which we fall short." p. 50
How people run their workplaces and labs are indicators of how they really feel about democracy. Some would prefer to live in a more ordered society where everyone is bound to a role for life.
The fascist aspiration is for human societies to work like ants. But this misunderstands the nature of humans, who are capable of variety and possibility. By making human society ant-like it is "limiting the modes in which we may adapt ourselves to future contingencies, they reduce our changes for a reasonably long existence on this earth." p. 52
