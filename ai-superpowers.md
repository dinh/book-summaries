# AI Superpowers - China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order

## Ch. 1 China's Sputnik Moment

China's sputnik moment was seeing AlphaGo beat a human chess player.
When the USSR launched Sputnik, it "sparked widespread US public anxiety about perceived Soviet technological superiority".
US AI advances have provoked similar response from China. The central government has poured money into AI research, surpassing the US for the first time in 2017.

Most analysts think China's tech sector is destined to lag behind cutting edge AI tech, as it has for decades, but it will actually be a major beneficiary.
The advances in deep learning that have sparked this wave of AI are not signifying rapid progress towards general AI, because this is the age of implementation, similar to the discovery of electricity.
China has an abundance of the factors needed to harness the power of AI: abundant data, hungry entrepreneurs, AI scientists, and an AI-friendly policy environment.

Silicon Valley is sluggish in comparison to the Chinese startup environment, where the competition is much more cutthoat. Copying is not stigmatized, so companies must have a much bigger "moat" than a novel idea to succeed.
Around 2013, Chinese companies began innovating in ways that surpassed SV. Mobile payments, on demand services, online-to-offline startups bringing e-commerce to bear on the real world. WeChat became the universal social app, and captures all of that data.
The Chinese central government is effective at setting long-term goals and mobilizing resources towards it. In sharp contrast to US which is slashing funding for basic research.

Author believes China will soon match or overtake the US in developing and deploying AI, and the geopolitical balance of power will tilt in China's favor.
Yet the crisis between superpowers will be overshadowed by a bigger crisis of job losses and growing inequality due to automation and winner-take-all economies. AI naturally trends towards winner-take-all economics because aggregation of data creates a self-reinforcing cycle of better and better products.
Biggest threat is tremendous social disorder and political collapse.

## Ch 2. Copycats in the Coliseum

Chinese startup ecosystem: cultural acceptance of copying, a scarcity mentality, and the willingness to dive into any promising new industry.

Wang Xing, Chinese serial entrepreneur, shamelessly copied US tech startups for years. SV looked down upon this pixel-by-pixel cloning, but his Chinese copy of Groupon, Meituan, not only beat Groupon in the Chinese startup market but branched into many new lines of business. Metaphor is of a gladiator emerging victorious from a competition involving over five thousand copycat group buying companies.

SV startup culture tend to be mission-driven, starting with novel idea or idealistic goal. Chinese startup culture is primarily market-driven; goal is to make money, and will have incredible flexibility of business model to achieve goal. Many Chinese entrepreneurs are one generation away from grinding poverty, so are very survival oriented.
SV companies resist localization that goes beyond superficial changes, seeing their task primarily as marketing their product in China as opposed to tailing their products to Chinese users.

## Ch 3. China's Alternate Internet Universe

China's tech hub Zhongguancun was created by a government initiative to create a startup ecosystem. They cleared out a street, named it the Avenue of the Entrepreneurs, and got investors and entrepreneurs to come.
A giant government initiative in 2014, "Mass Innovation and Mass Entrepreneurship", started "innovation zones" all across the country. Top-down innovation succeeded in kickstarting a domestic startup ecosystem. (And they're applying this model again to AI.)
They directly subsidized tech entrepreneurs, gave tax discounts and rent rebates to startups. Created government-backed "guiding funds" to attract more private venture capital, increasing the upside for private investors by capping the government's upside from the fund at a predetermined percentage. Opened 6600 new startup incubators across the nation. Used government money to brute-force a fast transformation, at the cost of some inefficiency - some things never paid off, but nationwide there was a huge impact.
China's data advantage - a lot of people, with little privacy protections.

Chinese companies "go heavy" - don't tend to stick to just building software, but get deeply involved in building economies of scale by mastering logistics and having feet on the ground.
Adoption of mobile payments happened at lightning speed. Americans already benefit from credit cards, but for Chinese market it was jumping straight from cash. WeChat also essentially bribed users to sign up.

## Ch 4. A Tale of Two Countries

In 1999 Chinese students trying to study AI were studying old textbooks by streetlight at night after the dorm lights were out. In today's information-rich environment, they are primed to succeed.
We are witnessing the application of one fundamental breakthrough to many different problems, which means people can just learn and apply. US is still home to top researchers, but their work is instantly available to Chinese counterparts. Chinese practitioners are also contributing greatly to ecosystem. In 2017 a leading AI conference had accepted an equal number of papers from researchers from China and the US.

If next breakthrough happens in a corporate research division, it could pose a threat to world's open AI ecosystem and China's goal of becoming global leader in AI. It will probably come from an open research environment, but if it comes from a company, Google has the best shot.

Obama's AI plan barely made a splash, and Trump proposed cutting funding for AI research. In contrast, the Chinese government's AI plan called for China to reach the top tier of AI economies by 2020, and set of a national mobilization. Is likely to be somewhat inefficient by extremely effective.

China has techno-utilitarian approach, will roll something out despite downsides as long as there are significant upsides. Will make big bets on game-changing technologies.

## Ch. 5 The Four Waves of AI

Internet, business, perception, and autonomous AI. Believes that in 5 years China will close the gap. Will lag in the corporate world, but may leapfrog ahead in public services and industries.

Province of Zhejiang has announced plans to build first intelligent superhighway, outfitted for autonomous and electric vehicles. Xiong'an New Area 60 miles south of Beijing is being turned into government showcase city as big as Chicago, built to accomodate autonomous vehicles. If the bottleneck is technology, SV has a headstart, but if it's policy, the Chinese government's approach will probably win out.

## Ch. 6 Utopia, Dystopia, and the Real AI Crisis

Some fear imminent AGI and the singularity, but there is no known engineering route to get there, and it would require a series of foundational breakthroughs. We're at a new plateau, and the real threat here is a crisis of jobs and inequality.

A revolution in manufacturing will kick away the ladder of economic development which allowed China to lift itself out of poverty. Within countries, companies with an AI and data advantage will tend toward monopoly, eliminating competition and concentrating economic power. And people displaced by machines will face the existential question of what it means to be human in an age of intelligent machines.

General-purpose technologies (GPTs) are significant enough to be in a class of their own, and only three recent ones stand out: the steam engine, electricity, and information and communication technologies. Steam and electricity created the modern factory system, led to deskilling - broke previously high-skill tasks into simple components done by low-skill workers. ICTs led to growth in productivity, but stagnation of wages. Is skill biased in favor of high skilled workers, empowers the world's top knowledge workers and undercuts the economic role of many in the middle. AI replaces tasks that can be optimized using data and do not require social interaction. The transition will be much faster this time. Many professions that form the bedrock of the middle class will be hollowed out.

## Ch. 7 The Wisdom of Cancer

Author got cancer, stopped workaholic lifestyle to refocus on love and relationships. Had revelation around centering human role in economy around care work, while letting the rest be automated.

## Ch. 8 A Blueprint for Human Coexistence with AI

Technical fixes for adapting to automation: Reduce, retrain, redistribute.

UBI - pay everyone. A simple technical solution, but would cause major change in social contract. Seems like a quick fix to problems caused by tech favored by SV elites because it seems like a palliative. A magic wand. Will it benefit people across society or simply prevent social upheaval? Will it build new institutions or simply absolve consciences?

Another proposal: Social Investment Stipend, for care, service, and education. Like a foundation to fund and reward socially beneficial activities. Provides stipend in exchange for participation in prosocial activities.

Start by increasing government support for parents, subsidies for job retraining, expand number of public school teachers.

## Ch 9. Our Global AI Story

AI development is seen by some as a zero-sum game, where China's win is America's loss, and vice versa. But this should not be a new Cold War. The greatest potential for disruption is domestic.
